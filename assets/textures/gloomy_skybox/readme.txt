====================================

A gloomy looking sky.
Bottom half is left open, so you can throw whatever you wish in there.

Technical Tidbits
====================================

Files are 24bit PNG, sides are 512*512px.

The sides are named and oriented in the Quake tradition, you might need to re-orient them for engines that use a different cubemap/skybox layout.
